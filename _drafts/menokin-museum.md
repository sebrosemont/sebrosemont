In the Northern Neck of Virginia, along a tributary to the Rappahanock, sits the former house of Francis Lightfoot Lee, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. The Menokin Foundation has worked tirelessly to preserve what remains of the house with a modern twist by enclosing it in glass. Most importantly, Menokin is a steward of the property, offering outdoor and educational opportunities for the local community, and its history, creating space for the descendents of enslaved people forced to work on the plantation to share their stories. 

One recent community event was [Makers Day](https://www.menokin.org/makers-day-2024) during which local craftspeople and organizations held demostrations on everything from Native American eel pots to glass blowing to brickmaking, and also had space to sell locally made products. 

I had the pleasure to create the site map for the event which you can see below.
