While learning QGIS, I found many great resources available online to build new skills and efectively use the software. I enjoyed the self guided tutorials from Columbia University Center for Spatial Research, available for free on GitHub, and found them to be easy to follow and useful for skill development. https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/mapping_architecture_urbanism_humanities/blob/master/README.md
 
Below are the maps I created based on the tutorials. In some cases I used more recent data from New York City for my maps.
