To celebrate the Baltimore Orioles (the baseball team) winning 100 games in 2023, I made a map of recorded sightings by birdwartchers in the United States by county. 

There were over 1 millions recorded sightings across the US. This map focuses on the northern and eastern parts of the coutry - the regular summer habitat for Baltimore Orioles.
