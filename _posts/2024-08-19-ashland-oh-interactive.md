The [Ashland Source](https://www.ashlandsource.com) is reporting on the socio-economic differences in Ashland, Ohio. They are focused on the disadvantaged areas and, more specifically, how ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) stimulus funds are being used. 

I am developing interactive maps to accompany the series. 

The first installment of the series is [here](https://www.ashlandsource.com/2024/08/19/following-the-arpa-money/), and the map I created is below:
