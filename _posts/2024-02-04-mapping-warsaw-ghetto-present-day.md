What would the Warsaw Ghetto look like mapped onto the present day city? Here are two maps where I have digitized the walls, gates, synagogues, and other features from the 1940 Warsaw Ghetto and overlayed them onto the present day street map of Warsaw. 

The first map below uses a layout of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940 from the YIVO Insitute for Jewish Research. This map was overlayed onto Open Street Maps present day map of Warsaw.

After supressing the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Nazis destroyed the ghetto in 1943. Entire city blocks were leveled and almost no structures remained standing. The only synagogue to survive was the No≈ºyk Synagogue (the southernmost synagogue on the map).
